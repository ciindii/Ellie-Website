      <h3>Cancellation:</h3>
      <p>Please keep in mind that there is a $50.00 non-refundable cancellation fee.<br> If you cannot make your appointment please give a 48 hour notice to cancel or reschedule. Less than a 48-hour notice will result a fee equal to 50% of your reserved
        service amount.
        <br> If you need to cancel or reschedule please text or call us at: <br><br>

        <h3>Before your lash appointment:</h3>
        <p><b>Please remove all eye make-up prior to your appointment.</b>
        When you come in with make up on your lashes, it will take me at least 10-15 minutes cleaning them and that means less time for actually lashing you. Plus keep in mind that you can't expect 4-5 weeks retention when you are coming for refills with dirty eyelashes.
        If you are coming in for a fill, and your lashes are not clean like the picture shown
        <a href="img/dirtyLashes.jpg" target="_blank" class="dirtyLashLink">HERE</a>
        I have to remove them all to do deep clean and a full set.
        <b>I will have to charge a full set and removal.</b> Please try to wash them and keep them clean. Thanks for understanding

      <h3>Brows:</h3>
      <p>
        The eyebrow area will be slightly red after the procedure and color will appear very dark. This is normal for the procedure and part of the healing process. The color will fade by up to 40% as it heals. In the following days, the eyebrows will continue
        to be dark and you will notice slight scabbing. Do not pick at the scabs as this may damage the skin and the outcome of the microbladed area. The eyebrows will lighten up in color as it heals. No down time is required after microblading procedure.
        It takes approximately 7-14 days for the brows to heal over, and about 1 month for the color to fully set in. You'll notice the color is very light right after the two weeks after healing; the skin will have an opaque milky looking quality to
        it. This is known as the milk skin and is common in tattooing. This is due to the the tissue still healing from the inside out even though the surface of the skin is healed. True color will reveal itself once healed.
      </p> <br>
      <h3>Lashes:</h3>
      <p>
        Is it crucial to wash your eyelids and lashes every day.
        Over some time dead skin, make up, oils, dust and debris are building up on your eyelids. This can cause bacteria and may lead to serious infections. This also creates the perfect environment for lash mites to live, because they feed on oils. Don't be afraid to wash your lashes, even if you loose 1-2 extensions in the process, it will keep bacteria away and your eyelashes clean and fresh and your extensions will last longer after they are applied to clean lashes.
